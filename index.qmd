I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) in the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.
My research focuses on understanding how genetics and environmental factors influence disease risk, especially cancer, and how this risk can be predicted equitably across populations.
