I am a 2nd year PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) in the Bloomberg School of Public Health  at Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on understanding how genetics and environmental factors influence disease risk, and how this risk differs across populations.
