I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) in the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.
My research focuses on understanding how genetics and environmental factors influence disease risk, and how this risk differs across populations.
