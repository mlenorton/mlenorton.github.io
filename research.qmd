## Areas of Research  

My primary research interests are in Statistical Genetics and Genomics, Risk Prediction, Missing Data, and Semi-Parametric Methods. My thesis research focuses on building better risk prediction models that perform equitably across diverse populations to help promote precision prevention. I currently build and validate cancer risk prediction models using very large and diverse data that combine classical risk factors (e.g. demographics, lifestyle, and environmental variables) and polygenic risk scores in a single model. To support this work, I am developing new transfer learning techniques to facilitate combining information across data sources that exhibit complex patterns of missing data. 

## Papers in Progress
