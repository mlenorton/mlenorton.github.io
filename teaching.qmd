## Teaching Philosophy

Coming soon.

## Teaching Duties  

As a lead teaching assistant for the 620 series, I conducted laboratory sessions for up to ~50 students, during which I introduced new statistical concepts and reviewed topics previously covered in lecture.  I tried to make my lectures as participatory as possible, often asking and answering questions throughout my presentation. As a teaching assistant, I held office hours (up to 5 hours per week). I also graded and provided feedback on students’ homework. By TA’ing for the 620 series and a summer workshop, I have become familiar with Stata and gained experience teaching MPH students the statistical concepts listed on the curriculum for PH 321 (e.g. statistical inference, regression, correlation, and hypothesis testing).
