@article{Morgenstern:1982aa,
	abstract = {A general method is proposed for estimating the potential impact of a prevention program involving risk factor modification on the incidence of specific diseases in a target population. An evaluative framework for comparing alternative intervention strategies is also presented. On the basis of results from epidemiologic studies, the user must specify certain parameters regarding the distribution of the risk factor that is to be modified in the population, the magnitude of the association between the risk factor and disease, and the total risk of disease in the population. A quantitative measure, called the potential impact fraction, is derived to estimate the proportion of expected new cases that may be prevented under intervention programs of varying success. Estimates of this measure are then used to assess the potential efficacy, effectiveness, adequacy, and efficiency of planned intervention strategies. The method is illustrated with published data relating relative weight and coronary heart disease among middle-aged U.S. men, comparing different strategies of weight reduction. Key assumptions of the method and interpretation of results are discussed.},

@article{Steenland:2006aa,
	abstract = {There are a number of measures that quantify the public health burden due to specific risk factors for specific diseases. Although these measures are of importance for policymakers, epidemiologists do not often calculate them or may be unfamiliar with some of the issues involved when they do. The primary measure of interest is the attributable fraction (AF), representing the fraction of cases or deaths from a specific disease that would not have occurred in the absence of exposure to a specific risk factor either in the exposed population or the population as a whole. AFs can be multiplied by the total number of cases of a given disease to obtain a "body count"--the absolute number of preventable cases due to a specific risk factor. Two other measures of public health burden, used in conjunction with AFs, are attributable years-of-life-lost and attributable disability-adjusted life-years. We provide an overview of the AF and related measures and discuss some of the specific issues involved in calculating AFs. These issues include calculating the variance of AFs (such as Monte Carlo sensitivity methods), biases arising from some formulas for the AF, sources of data for calculating AFs, dependence of AFs on basic decisions about what exposure-disease associations are causal, and extrapolation from the source population to the target population.},

@article{Walter:1983aa,
	abstract = {The properties of attributable risk are discussed for situations in which there are several risk factors that are possibly interacting or confounded. Conditions are identified when the attributable risk among the exposed is constant, when the marginal attributable risk estimate is valid, and when the public health effects of separate risks are additive. Such conditions reflect, in various ways, the interaction and confounding of the different risk factors involved. For diseases with more than two risk factors, these conditions are sufficient but not necessary; thus it is possible to have additive public health effects of two risk factors even though they are confounded and interactive. In contrast, when there are exactly two binary risk factors, the conditions are sufficient and necessary. It is shown that bias in attributable risk through misclassification of exposure arises primarily through insensitivity errors. Particularly with zero false negative rates and equal false positive rates for cases and controls, the attributable risk estimate is unbiased; however, a larger standard error pertains to the estimate based on misclassified data.},

@article{Tammemagi:2014aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lung cancer risks at which individuals should be screened with computed tomography (CT) for lung cancer are undecided. This study's objectives are to identify a risk threshold for selecting individuals for screening, to compare its efficiency with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for identifying screenees, and to determine whether never-smokers should be screened. Lung cancer risks are compared between smokers aged 55-64 and ≥ 65-80 y. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Applying the PLCO(m2012) model, a model based on 6-y lung cancer incidence, we identified the risk threshold above which National Lung Screening Trial (NLST, n = 53,452) CT arm lung cancer mortality rates were consistently lower than rates in the chest X-ray (CXR) arm. We evaluated the USPSTF and PLCO(m2012) risk criteria in intervention arm (CXR) smokers (n = 37,327) of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). The numbers of smokers selected for screening, and the sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values (PPVs) for identifying lung cancers were assessed. A modified model (PLCOall2014) evaluated risks in never-smokers. At PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151, the 65th percentile of risk, the NLST CT arm mortality rates are consistently below the CXR arm's rates. The number needed to screen to prevent one lung cancer death in the 65th to 100th percentile risk group is 255 (95% CI 143 to 1,184), and in the 30th to <65th percentile risk group is 963 (95% CI 291 to -754); the number needed to screen could not be estimated in the <30th percentile risk group because of absence of lung cancer deaths. When applied to PLCO intervention arm smokers, compared to the USPSTF criteria, the PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151 threshold selected 8.8% fewer individuals for screening (p<0.001) but identified 12.4% more lung cancers (sensitivity 80.1% [95% CI 76.8%-83.0%] versus 71.2% [95% CI 67.6%-74.6%], p<0.001), had fewer false-positives (specificity 66.2% [95% CI 65.7%-66.7%] versus 62.7% [95% CI 62.2%-63.1%], p<0.001), and had higher PPV (4.2% [95% CI 3.9%-4.6%] versus 3.4% [95% CI 3.1%-3.7%], p<0.001). In total, 26% of individuals selected for screening based on USPSTF criteria had risks below the threshold PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151. Of PLCO former smokers with quit time >15 y, 8.5% had PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151. None of 65,711 PLCO never-smokers had PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151. Risks and lung cancers were significantly greater in PLCO smokers aged ≥ 65-80 y than in those aged 55-64 y. This study omitted cost-effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The USPSTF criteria for CT screening include some low-risk individuals and exclude some high-risk individuals. Use of the PLCO(m2012) risk ≥ 0.0151 criterion can improve screening efficiency. Currently, never-smokers should not be screened. Smokers aged ≥ 65-80 y are a high-risk group who may benefit from screening. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers share some hormonal and epidemiologic risk factors. While several models predict absolute risk of breast cancer, there are few models for ovarian cancer in the general population, and none for endometrial cancer. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using data on white, non-Hispanic women aged 50+ y from two large population-based cohorts (the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial [PLCO] and the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study [NIH-AARP]), we estimated relative and attributable risks and combined them with age-specific US-population incidence and competing mortality rates. All models included parity. The breast cancer model additionally included estrogen and progestin menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use, other MHT use, age at first live birth, menopausal status, age at menopause, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, benign breast disease/biopsies, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI); the endometrial model included menopausal status, age at menopause, BMI, smoking, oral contraceptive use, MHT use, and an interaction term between BMI and MHT use; the ovarian model included oral contraceptive use, MHT use, and family history or breast or ovarian cancer. In independent validation data (Nurses' Health Study cohort) the breast and ovarian cancer models were well calibrated; expected to observed cancer ratios were 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-1.04) for breast cancer and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.97-1.19) for ovarian cancer. The number of endometrial cancers was significantly overestimated, expected/observed = 1.20 (95% CI: 1.11-1.29). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs; discriminatory power) were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.57-0.59), 0.59 (95% CI: 0.56-0.63), and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66-0.70) for the breast, ovarian, and endometrial models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These models predict absolute risks for breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers from easily obtainable risk factors and may assist in clinical decision-making. Limitations are the modest discriminatory ability of the breast and ovarian models and that these models may not generalize to women of other races.

@article{Benichou:2001aa,
	abstract = {This paper reviews adjusted methods of estimation of attributable risk (AR), that is methods that allow one to obtain estimates of AR while controlling for other factors. Estimability and basic principles of AR estimation are first considered and the rationale for adjusted AR estimators is discussed. Then, adjusted AR estimators are reviewed focusing on cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies. Two inconsistent adjusted estimators are briefly commented upon. Next, adjusted estimators based on stratification, namely the weighted-sum and Mantel-Haenszel (MH) approaches, are reviewed and contrasted. It appears that the weighted-sum approach, which allows for full interaction between exposure and adjustment factors, can be affected by small-sample bias. By contrast, the MH approach, which rests on the assumption of no interaction between exposure and adjustment factors may be misleading if interaction between exposure and adjustment factors is present. Model-based adjusted estimators represent a more general and flexible approach that includes both stratification approaches as special cases and offers intermediate options. Bruzzi et al.'s and Greenland and Drescher's estimators are reviewed and contrasted. Finally, special problems of adjusted estimation are considered, namely estimation from case-cohort data, estimation for risk factors with multiple levels, for multiple risk factors, for recurrent events, estimation of the prevented and preventable fractions, and estimation of the generalized impact fraction. Comments on future directions are presented.},

@techreport{Nelson:2013aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and PsycINFO (January 2002 to December 31, 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (4th Quarter 2012), Scopus, and reference lists were searched for English-language studies of benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce BRCA-related cancer and mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen general risk models, such as the Gail model, are modest predictors of individual risk for breast cancer (c-statistic, 0.55 to 0.65). Five familial risk models for nongenetics specialists to guide referrals to genetic counseling accurately predict individual risk for BRCA mutations (c-statistic, >0.80). No studies reported harms of risk assessment. Sixteen studies indicated that genetic counseling decreases cancer worry, anxiety, and depression; increases the accuracy of risk perception; and decreases intention for mutation testing. Thirty-two new studies and 38 earlier studies provided data for meta-analysis estimates of the prevalence and penetrance of BRCA mutations. Prevalence varies by population: 0.2 to 0.3 percent in general populations, 3 percent in women with breast cancer, 6 percent in women with breast cancer onset before age 40 years, 10 percent in women with ovarian cancer, and 20 percent in high-risk families. Among Ashkenazi Jewish women, prevalence is 2 percent in unselected populations and 10 percent in high-risk families. The penetrance of BRCA mutations differs by test result. Breast cancer penetrance to age 70 years if the test is positive is 46 to 71 percent for BRCA1 or BRCA2; ovarian cancer penetrance is 41 to 46 percent for BRCA1 and 17 to 23 percent for BRCA2. No estimates were available for women with variants of uncertain significance. The standardized incidence rate for breast cancer is 3.81 (95% CI, 3.06 to 4.75) for uninformative negative test results and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.58) for true negative results. Estimates for ovarian cancer were highly heterogeneous. Breast cancer worry and anxiety increased after testing in women with positive results and decreased in others, although results differed across studies. Risk perception improved after receiving test results. No trials of the effectiveness of intensive screening for breast or ovarian cancer in women who are mutation carriers have been published. False-positive rates, unnecessary imaging, and unneeded surgery were higher in women undergoing intensive screening. Most women experienced no anxiety after screening with magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, or clinical breast examination, although women recalled for additional testing had transient anxiety. There are no trials of risk-reducing medications specifically in women who are mutation carriers. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduced invasive breast cancer by 30 to 68 percent in placebo-controlled trials enrolling women with various levels of risk; tamoxifen had a greater effect than raloxifene in a head-to-head trial. Results suggested that reduction was greater in women with more relatives with breast cancer, but confidence intervals overlapped and results were not specific for women who are mutation carriers. Tamoxifen and raloxifene increased thromboembolic events and tamoxifen increased endometrial cancer and cataracts. In high-risk women and women who are mutation carriers, risk-reducing mastectomy reduced breast cancer by 85 to 100 percent and breast cancer mortality by 81 to 100 percent; risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy reduced breast cancer by 37 to 100 percent, ovarian cancer by 69 to 100 percent, and all-cause mortality by 55 to 100 percent. Some women experienced physical complications of surgery, postsurgical symptoms, or changes in body image; some had improved anxiety. LIMITATIONS: Including only English-language articles and studies applicable to the United States; varying number, quality, and applicability of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Risk assessment using familial risk models to guide referrals is accurate. Genetic counseling reduces distress, improves risk perception, and reduces intention for testing. Genetic testing provides risk estimates for specific populations depending on test results. A true negative test indicates no increased risk for breast cancer. The effectiveness of intensive screening is not known, but it increases false-positive results and procedures. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce risk for breast cancer, but have adverse effects. Risk-reducing mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are effective in reducing breast and ovarian cancer. Several evidence gaps remain and additional studies are necessary to better inform practice.},

@article{Antoniou:2003aa,
	abstract = {Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer high risks of breast and ovarian cancer, but the average magnitude of these risks is uncertain and may depend on the context. Estimates based on multiple-case families may be enriched for mutations of higher risk and/or other familial risk factors, whereas risk estimates from studies based on cases unselected for family history have been imprecise. We pooled pedigree data from 22 studies involving 8,139 index case patients unselected for family history with female (86%) or male (2%) breast cancer or epithelial ovarian cancer (12%), 500 of whom had been found to carry a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Breast and ovarian cancer incidence rates for mutation carriers were estimated using a modified segregation analysis, based on the occurrence of these cancers in the relatives of mutation-carrying index case patients. The average cumulative risks in BRCA1-mutation carriers by age 70 years were 65% (95% confidence interval 44%-78%) for breast cancer and 39% (18%-54%) for ovarian cancer. The corresponding estimates for BRCA2 were 45% (31%-56%) and 11% (2.4%-19%). Relative risks of breast cancer declined significantly with age for BRCA1-mutation carriers (P trend.0012) but not for BRCA2-mutation carriers. Risks in carriers were higher when based on index breast cancer cases diagnosed at <35 years of age. We found some evidence for a reduction in risk in women from earlier birth cohorts and for variation in risk by mutation position for both genes. The pattern of cancer risks was similar to those found in multiple-case families, but their absolute magnitudes were lower, particularly for BRCA2. The variation in risk by age at diagnosis of index case is consistent with the effects of other genes modifying cancer risk in carriers.},

	abstract = {The health damage from tobacco use has been studied intensively, yet quantifying the precise burden of disease and death due to smoking is a complex problem, and consequently open to manipulation by interested parties. The goals of this paper are to clearly communicate the concept of the attributable fraction (AF), i.e., the proportion of disease in a population which can be attributed to a risk factor, and to understand the relationship between the AF, the prevalence of exposure in a population, and the relative risk of disease given the exposure. The current approach to calculating the AF is summarized. An intuitive formula is proposed, with accompanying graphical illumination. For diseases caused by smoking, the AF of disease due to smoking increases with the prevalence of smoking and with the relative risk of disease due to smoking. The proposed method has the potential to help health professionals and decision makers understand the concept of the burden of disease due to smoking or other lifestyle, environmental, and occupational factors, in the context of public health importance. This will aid sound decision-making in public health policy.},
