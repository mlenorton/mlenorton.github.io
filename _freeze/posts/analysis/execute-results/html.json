this example analysis, I investigate patterns in abundance and distribution of birds in the 2020-21 winter in the United States and southern Canada.\nSpecifically, I aim to answer the following questions:\n\n-   when and where are birds observed\n-   which species are most common, and where are they found\n-   which species tend to occur in large flocks, and where are they found\n\nThis analysis is intended for the general public, as well as the citizen scientists (and the graders for Biostat 777).\n\n### Data from Project FeederWatch\n\nThese data were discovered via [TidyTuesday for January 10, 2023](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-10), but originally come from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/).\nProject FeederWatch is a citizen science project that aims to engage individuals in North America to count birds (for as long or as little as they like) to track winter trends in bird distribution and abundance.\nThis project has been running for more than 30 years at this point!\n@Bonter_and_Greig_2021_Proj_FeederWatch The data dictionary is available

observing locations in this figure since it will be relevant for understanding the distribution of common and flocking birds examined below.\n:::\n\nSince most bird-watching happens in the mid-latitudes (defined here as 35-45ºN), we must standardize the number of birds by the number of observations.\nThe following figure indicates that birds are more abundant at higher latitudes even though there are fewer total observations.\nHowever, birds become more common at lower latitudes (\\<35ºN) from January to March.\nThis may be explained by migration to southern regions during the coldest months of the year.\nThe fact that more birds are reported within every latitudinal band during the coldest months may indicate that more birds visit feeders to obtain food during the harshest conditions of the year.\n\n### \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Figure 2: Bird count per latitude band\nbird_count_per_day %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y = std_total, color = lat_band)) +   \n
